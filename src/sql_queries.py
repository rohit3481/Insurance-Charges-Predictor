"""Reusable SQL queries against the project's SQLite database.

The cleaned dataset is loaded into a single `applicants` table (with a
`split` column marking train/val/test membership). Both the ingestion
component and the Streamlit EDA page query this table directly with SQL
rather than only ever manipulating an in-memory dataframe — this mirrors
how a data scientist would typically pull a modelling dataset out of a
real analytical database.
